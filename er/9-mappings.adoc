== Mappings between MUDDI and Candidate Models

This section presents provisional mappings between MUDDI entities and those of candidate models described in <<CandidateModels,Section 6>>. Some mappings may be direct, broader, or narrower. There may also be different cardinalities, e.g. one MUDDI entity mapping into multiple entities in a different model. The mappings presented here are a first pass for developing data conversion routines, as well as guiding future MUDDI implementations.
