== MUDDI Modules and Interfaces


=== Modules
The following tables describe core MUDDI elements and some extended elements. The relations and attributes shown in the module tables may realize optional (but commonly used) interfaces. Other interface relations, attributes, and operations are shown below.

Each of these elements include attributes that describe the specific class or type classification of more specialized instances, such as _containerClass_. This allows aggregation of diverse utility structures without losing their more specialized identities. More general MUDDI elements such as _NetworkLink_ could also be specialized for the specific utility types listed in <<UtilityTypes,Section 6>> and/or for specialized types that characterize the candidate models. Such subclass entities are not (yet) included in this report.
