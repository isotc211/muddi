<title>Summary</title>
<simpara>The Underground Infrastructure Concept Development Study (UICDS) Engineering Report [<link linkend="Lieberman2017">1</link>] examined the present state of underground infrastructure information (UGII), costs and benefits of that state, as well as future opportunities for an improved state. That report describes a number of candidate models for UGII and recommends a number of follow-on activities, including development of a prototype UGII integration model to support subsequent UGII integration and exchange initiatives. A follow-up workshop and model development effort resulted in another engineering report describing an initial (1.0) version of the conceptual UGII integration model MUDDI (Model for Underground Data Definition and Interchange) [<link linkend="Lieberman2018">2</link>].  The present updated report describes MUDDI version 1.1. The goal of MUDDI is to serve as the basis for integration of datasets from different models, at the levels of detail required to address application use cases described in [<link linkend="Lieberman2017">1</link>]. MUDDI as described here is a conceptual model which will serve as the basis for one or more conformant and interchangeable logical and physical implementations such as GML (Geographic Markup Language) or SFS (Simple Features SQL). The current version 1.1 of MUDDI has been updated and refined from the initial version 1.0, but is still intended to serve as an input to the proposed OGC Underground Infrastructure Pilot as well as similar implementations and deployments in realistic application scenarios. The present model is also suitable as input to begin development of a formal conceptual model standard.</simpara>

<title>Requirements &amp; Research Motivation</title>
<simpara>The development of MUDDI has been motivated by a number of specific design requirements described in the <link linkend="overview">Overview</link> but the principal motivation has been to achieve compatibility and minimal information loss with regard to data represented by several significant existing models and model standards, in order to support both data interchange and data integration across a variety of underground infrastructure components, functions, and associated environmental properties.</simpara>

<title>Prior-After Comparison</title>
<simpara>Findings presented in [<link linkend="Lieberman2017">1</link>] describe the present generally inadequate state of UGII in many cities and suburban regions. The model presented here, and subsequent pilot activities based on it, along with needed policy, financial, and cultural advances,  have the potential to improve UGII quality, reduce incurred costs, and provide numerous opportunities to improve how cities function.</simpara>

<simpara>The Underground Infrastructure Concept Development Study (UICDS) Engineering Report [<link linkend="Lieberman2017">1</link>] examined the present state of underground infrastructure information (UGII), costs and benefits of that state, as well as future opportunities for an improved state. That report describes a number of candidate models for UGII and recommends a number of follow-on activities, including development of a prototype UGII integration model to support subsequent UGII integration and exchange initiatives.

The present model is also suitable as input to begin development of a formal conceptual model standard.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_design_requirements">
<title>Design Requirements</title>
<simpara>The development of MUDDI has been motivated by a number of specific design requirements:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>1) Functionality</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The model should specifically address three priority application use cases (Excavation, Large-scale Construction Design, Disaster Planning)</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>2) Compatibility</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The model should derive from or map to/from existing candidate models such as INSPIRE <link linkend="NR-INSPIRE-UN">[IUN]</link> (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community), CityGML UN ADE <link linkend="NR-CityGML-UN-ADE">[CUA]</link> (Utility Networks Application Domain Extension), GeoSciML <link linkend="NR-GeoSciML">[GSML]</link>, or IMKL <link linkend="NR-IMKL">[IMKL]</link> (Informatie Model Kabels en Leidingen).</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>3) Modularity</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The model should have a modular structure with a simple mandatory core and additional elements in the form of optional extensions or interfaces, in order to minimize the quantity and detail of data required for specific use cases.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>4) Traceability</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The model should provide for UGII to be linked directly with the survey measurements, sensor observations, and supporting evidence from which it was derived and from which its quality can be determined.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>5) Flexibility</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The model should support implementations that include the geometric and topological representations needed for specific applications, such as 2D geometries for excavation planning, 3D geometries for construction design, or functional graph topologies for disaster vulnerability assessments.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_design_patterns">
<title>Design Patterns</title>
<simpara>There are a number of common model design patterns which might satisfy MUDDI requirements, particularly modularity and flexibility:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Relational</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>the pattern of fixed tables connected by foreign key relations. Clearly an established implementation pattern, but tends to result in duplication of data to support specialization and rather brittle relationships between model elements.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Graph</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>an extremely flexible pattern of data elements connected by diverse relation predicates tends to represent knowledge webs and physical networks very well, but is still hard to implement for spatial data.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Object</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>inheritance patterns are particularly well suited to UML modeling, but specialization hierarchies themselves can lack flexibility in terms of being able to choose different configurations of specialized attributes for specific applications.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Interface</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>a variant of the object model in which specializations can also be supported by the addition of  interface elements (consisting of attributes and/or operations) to primary objects. Interfaces can be mixed and matched as well as reused for different primary objects, but the variety of ways in which they can be implemented may present a risk of non-interoperability between implementations.</simpara>

<simpara>The following 6 UGII application use cases are detailed in [<link linkend="Lieberman2017">1</link>] and the first 3 use cases are considered a priority for the OGC Underground Pilot.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_use_cases">
<title>Use cases</title>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Routine street excavations (EX)</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>There are on average between 30 and 40 excavations annually per mile of roadway in many developed areas. Since urban and even suburban underground space is typically crowded with many different utility lines, most jurisdictions require that utilities share their data at the location of a proposed excavation in order to avoid utility strikes, which can cause extensive damage and result in significant costs and delays. In many cases, mark-up crews must locate records for the street in question and bring them out into the field in their vehicles. Information sharing and collaboration consists of "graffiti-style" sketches made on the street with spray paint or chalk. Getting all the utilities to respond routinely takes several days to a couple of weeks – if essential records can be located at all. The effectiveness of the street markup process depends upon the often questionable, rarely documented, and even more rarely tested accuracy and completeness of the records being referenced.</simpara>
<simpara>With utilities records in standards-based digital formats, information requests can be answered with digital submissions from each utility. Because the utility data is in a common format, it can be seamlessly integrated by excavators and used to guide underground work. Modern methods of data exchange, including wireless communications to mobile devices in the field, then make it possible to rapidly assemble utility information directly in the field, potentially lowering the strike risk and also reducing the time to mitigate strike hazards from days or weeks to minutes.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Planning, design and construction of large scale projects (AE)</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Cities and other large jurisdictions undergo constant change. At any one moment there may be a dozen or more new projects on the drawing boards and in construction. It is in the interests of these jurisdictions that new development be as economical as possible: that costs are held to a minimum and that projects are completed on schedule and in budget. To meet these objectives, project planners, engineers and architects need access to the best possible information to guide their plans and designs. They need to know if the capacity of utilities and characteristics of the underground environment can support the scale of the project envisioned. They will also need to know precisely where those utilities are located in order to properly plan building foundations and new building service connections. Answers to these questions require access to high quality information in a form that is straightforward to integrate and analyze.</simpara>
<simpara>Comprehensive and interoperable information about existing infrastructure networks is a pre-requisite for efficient planning and design for major new development. Information about existing and potential natural conditions is also essential for assessing both impacts to the environment and vulnerabilities to events such as flooding, hurricanes, and earthquakes. All of these need to be appropriately accounted for in good designs. When data are incomplete, incompatible, and difficult to find, this can lead to unduly large contract contingencies as well as significant delays in moving forward. Once construction does commence, unexpected discoveries of serious underlying conditions too often require very expensive change orders and long time delays. Major projects that cover a large area and extend over many years need continuing access to good underground data. If this access is not maintained, it adds additional cost and risk to the project.</simpara>

<simpara>Large scale disasters do not happen very often, but when they do, the failure to anticipate effects on major infrastructure features as well as on other components of the built environment that depend upon that infrastructure, can add billions to costs and result in the displacement, injury and death of large numbers of people. Disasters that are particularly associated with infrastructure failures include power blackouts, floods, tsunamis and storm surges; earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes and other high wind events; high heat events, fuel explosions, and terrorist attacks. A disaster event, at its most disabling, can lead to the failure of major utility generating, storage, control or transmission facilities, cutting off utility resources to large areas. Power failures caused by storm, flood or heat can black out an entire region and cause the shutdown of many critical facilities. A storm surge can flood transit and vehicular tunnels, short circuit electric substations and knock out basement utilities.  Interdependencies between infrastructure networks can mean that the failure of one system disables others in a cascading effect. Although not all the damage caused by a disaster event can be anticipated or prevented, any capacity to do so is utterly dependent on the rapid availability of high-quality, interoperable, geospatially enabled data for analyzing vulnerabilities to disaster consequences.</simpara>
<simpara>Interoperable underground utility data that depict large-scale and/or critical transmission, generation, or storage features with their physical and functional interconnections are particularly important. They enable analysis and simulation of the effects of a disaster event, development of protective strategies, and quick reaction to outages and damage. Such data are also important for identifying single points of failure, interdependencies, and triggers for cascading effects. Data about corresponding above-surface features along with underground environment characteristics such as permeability and saturation are also needed to examine the effects of disaster scenarios such as storm surge levels. Major utility features comprise only a small percentage of the overall utility infrastructure, which is dominated by street-level distribution branches; and concerns for their security often mitigate against data standardization and sharing. Nevertheless, without proper integration and analysis of data for both strategic and street-level infrastructure components, jurisdictions will remain hopelessly vulnerable and reactive to disaster events rather than properly prepared.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Utility related emergency response (ER)</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Bringing together utility information for routine excavations may take a significant amount of time, but there is far more urgency when dealing with a potential emergency. Not only must on-scene responders know about all the utility lines they may encounter, and their capacity, before excavation, but they also need to know about the location of utility control features that can rapidly shut off service in the event of a significant break. For example, when a water main leak is strongly suspected, a series of control valves must be located and shut off in sequence to stop the flow since a water supply system is a looped rather than a radial network. Soil and sediment data is also helpful in understanding whether flow and scour from a major water main break may undermine adjacent utility lines and nearby building foundations. Slow or incomplete delivery of this information can lead to a dangerous and costly event. Stories abound of utility workers at the scene of an incident huddling over paper plans on the hood of a truck, trying to figure out what might be happening.</simpara>
<simpara>Complete, accurate and interoperable underground infrastructure data available via wireless communications to the field can enable emergency field responders to rapidly understand the nature of a utility problem and to take informed action. Shut off valves can be quickly located and closed. Digging to expose the damaged pipe or conduit can be commenced immediately with confidence that all other utilities locations in the vicinity are known and can be avoided.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Private and public utility operations, maintenance, repair and replacement programs (OM)</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>All utilities have maintenance programs to ensure that their networks are functioning optimally with a minimum of complaints and outages. An important part of such maintenance operations is the replacement of old and obsolete infrastructure elements with new, safer and higher-capacity components. The ability to comprehensively analyze the performance of individual utility features as well as entire networks, on the basis of complete and accurate utility feature information including age, material, capacity and location, is essential for making economically responsible decisions. While installing new gas lines or electric conduit may be expensive, analysis can show it to be less expensive than dealing with major service outages when utility components fail or no longer meet demand.</simpara>
<simpara>Utility maintenance and repair processes depend upon data that relates complaints and problems to specific utility element locations and characteristics. Information about the underground environment, including earth materials and structures, moisture, vibration and the effects of adjacent utility lines, can also help utility analysts understand where segments of their networks are at greatest risk of corrosion, damage and breakage. As the use of utility-monitoring sensors becomes more widespread, additional layers of information and intelligence can be made available to support decision making processes.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Smart Cities, Future Cities (SC)</emphasis>
New generations of sensors and smart control valves that can be attached to underground infrastructure components are transforming the way in which infrastructure networks are monitored, and are revolutionizing the way infrastructure product delivery is managed. In turn, these sensors and controls will likely require new supportive power and telecommunications infrastructure, increasing the interdependencies between utilities. Furthermore, innovative technologies coming into use will require new types of utility services such as curb outlets for recharging electric vehicles and navigation infrastructure to guide autonomous vehicles. As underground networks adapt to such new developments, comprehensive knowledge of infrastructure locations and characteristics will be essential for modernization.</simpara>
<simpara>To keep up with the pace of technological transformation it will be necessary for jurisdictions to be prepared for major overhauls of their underground infrastructure environment. There is likely to be increased need to access buried networks and install new services as efficiently as possible. An important step in preparing for these changes will be to fully document the infrastructure that is currently in place, and to evolve standard data models for the new services and devices that are on the way. Losing track of what is underground will be a substantial barrier to realizing the benefits of future city innovations.</simpara>

<simpara>The UICDS contribution from Jef Daems of Informatie Vlaanderen highlights the adoption of IMKL in the KLIP system which facilitates the sharing of underground information from network operators in the Flanders region of Belgium in order to service excavation requests. The version of IMKL used in KLIP is based on the initial Dutch model and has evolved to meet the practical needs of excavators and the utility sector in Flanders. Essentially IMKL further specializes the specific utility network types defined in the INSPIRE theme model by inheriting additional properties from IMKL types such as Depth or ExtraTopography (Figure 4). This multiple inheritance pattern adding the IMKL Kabelenleiding (CableConduit) properties to the INSPIRE SewerPipe object is shown in Figure 5.</simpara>

<title>System context</title>
<simpara>As described in earlier sections of this report, the MUDDI model is intended to serve as a basis for integrating underground data from multiple sources, systems, and schemas. Datasets may be virtually integrated, so that each dataset is accessed remotely in the form of MUDDI data, or physically integrated and stored as MUDDI data in one system, either as a performance-enhancing cache, or as a tested and authoritative repository. With either system approach, the model requires multiple input interfaces that enable datasets to be mapped into the model from diverse sources, and multiple output interfaces that provide access to the right perspectives for each of several data-driven applications.</simpara>

<title>MUDDI model architecture</title>
<simpara>The MUDDI model consists of a small number of core entities derived from a general feature object, including network features, support and container features, and underground environment features. The core entities are further specialized for specific utility network types with both additional attributes and utility-specific type codes.</simpara>
<simpara>These core feature entities are then enhanced as needed by realizing one or more interfaces that support specific types of input data, transformations to/from significant external model schemas, additional geometry types such as 2D, 3D, and voxel, network connectivity and functionality, data quality measures, and so on that are further described in Section 7.</simpara>

<title>MUDDI core model elements</title>
<simpara>The MUDDI model packages are shown in Figure 10 and comprises a core package, network package, environment package, and package of extended interfaces. An additional package is an example of a logical model specialization of the conceptual model. The core MUDDI classes are shown in Figure 11. The root class of the model is MUDDIObject, whose attributes include many of those recommended for infrastructure assets in the ASCE As-Built draft specification</simpara>
<simpara>A child network object feature includes most of the other attributed specified by the ASCI As-Built is specialized by three network elements: a network node, a network surface node, and a network link. The basic network also includes network and network facility objects as well as simple optional relationships between them.</simpara>
<simpara>Two other MUDDIObject children are the container and support object features, for built structures which do not constitute directly either network infrastructure or environmental elements, but contain or support other infrastructure elements.</simpara>
<simpara>A significant update to the version 1.0 model is inclusion of a number of codelists shown in Figure 12 that provide both controlled and authoritative values for many of the attributes for the core MUDDI features.</simpara>

<simpara>Another MUDDIObject specialization shown in Figure 13 is the Environment Object feature, further specialized into features representing geological, hydrological, pedological (soil-specific), and phenomenological features of the subsurface environment. The general geometry type for these features will be a region bounded by surfaces, but interfaces add both cross-sections and borehole geometries as input and/or output capabilities.</simpara>

<title>MUDDI network entities and relationships</title>
<simpara>The combination of MUDDI network features and network-specific interfaces need only describe collections of network infrastructure elements, but may optionally support a number of distinct levels of network representation complexity, as well as levels of detail. Figure 11 hides the inheritance relations between the different network entities in order to focus on the relationships that can be represented between them. The IGraph interface adds these specific relationships. For example, networks can be related to each other as either subnetworks (containment) or subordinate networks (dependency). Networks consist of nodes and links, which in turn connect to each other. Relative to a particular network, however, either a node or a link may in addition serve as an interfacial element, belonging to more than one network or connecting to an element of another network.</simpara>
<simpara>A capability supported by CityGML UN ADE is the option to represent inter-network assemblages ("internal" relationship) which depict additional graph detail inside of what is represented as either a node or a link at a lower level of detail. This generally requires interfacial relations to describe the connection between the internal network and elements of the enclosing network</simpara>

<simpara>The MUDDI interfaces package comprises some 19 different interfaces that add geometric attributes, additional network relations, transformations to other model perspectives, and other capabilities to any parent or child object without the requirement for them to be carried along to further specializations.</simpara>

<title>Mappings between MUDDI and Candidate Models</title>
<simpara>This section presents provisional mappings between MUDDI entities and those of candidate models described in <link linkend="CandidateModels">Section 6</link>. Some mappings may be direct, broader, or narrower. There may also be different cardinalities, e.g. one MUDDI entity mapping into multiple entities in a different model. The mappings presented here are a first pass for developing data conversion routines, as well as guiding future MUDDI implementations.</simpara>
